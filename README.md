# Installing-Active-Directory

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I'll demonstrate how to install Active Directory Domain Services on Windows Server. We will then promote the server into a domain controller. A domain controller is just a computer or server that has Active Directory running on it. We will be using a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine (VM) for the demonstration of this lab.
<h2>Environment Used</h2>

- <b>Windows Server 2022</b> (Datacenter)

<h2>Windows Server Manager</h2>
To start of we will open the Server manager application in our Windows server VM.
